## Theory

&emsp;**Agent** is using DDPG algorithm to predict continuous actions in continuous state space. It has two networks: Actor and Critic.

## Inputs/Outputs

&emsp;The Actor network has 2 inputs from game: position, velocity. The output layer consists from fully-connected 'tanh()' layer for doing actions in range (-1.0, 1.0): force. Hidden layers are using Exponential linear unit (ELU) function.

&emsp;The Critic network has 2 inputs from game (states) and 1 input from Actor network (action). The main function of this network is estimate quality of the action[t] in the state[t] and use it to change gradient of Actor network by equation: 

    grad_J = (dQ / daction) * (daction / dA)

    grad_J ->  policy gradient,
    Q      ->  Q value from Critic net on (state, action) pair,
    action ->  deterministic policy predicated by Actor,
    A      ->  Actor's weights

The Critic network is trained by Bellman equation:
    
    Q_target = reward + (1-done) * gamma * Q_next_state

    Q_target       ->  Q value to be trained,
    reward         ->  reward from game for action in state,
    gamma          ->  discount factor,
    Q_next_state   ->  quality of action in next state 
    done           ->  1, if it's terminal state or 0 in non-terminal state
